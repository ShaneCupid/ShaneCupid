<h1 align="center">🔧✨ Architecting Human-Centered Systems with Applied AI 🌍🤖</h1>
<h3 align="center">📊🧠 Charting a Path Where Data Meets Human Impact 🚀💡</h3>

<h4 align="left">🎓 Education Snapshot:</h4>
<p>Currently completing my final semester in Penn State's MPS in Artificial Intelligence. Alongside academic rigor, I architect AI systems that bridge data, policy, and lived experience—empowering real-world users and organizations alike.</p>

<p>What’s on my plate this semester? <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>, <strong>Predictive Analytics</strong>, and <strong>Capstone Research</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Building agents that learn from interaction, optimize decision-making over time, and adapt within high-stakes environments.</li>
  <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> Developing forecasting models to surface insights from high-dimensional, real-world datasets—informing action in domains like healthcare and housing.</li>
  <li><strong>Capstone Project:</strong> Creating a next-generation clinical trial navigator that pairs patients with eligible trials and explains complex medical content using contextual AI. Designed to reduce barriers to research access and support provider communication.</li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left">📚 What else is catching my interest?</h4>
<p>Innovating at the intersection of AI and public infrastructure, with a specific focus on underserved families, social equity, and housing access.</p>
<p>Scaling automation and decision-support tools for real estate entrepreneurs through proprietary frameworks that reflect deep domain expertise in creative finance.</p>
<p>Leading tech innovation at MaxPeak Home Solutions, where we’re redefining what’s possible in real estate acquisition using intelligent systems, strategic outreach, and non-traditional capital structures.</p>
<p>Inspired by visionary operators like Pace Morby—my work goes beyond tactics to build enduring systems that support ethical, scalable real estate outcomes.</p>

<h4 align="left">🎯 Future Me:</h4>
<p>My vision is rooted in building AI systems that serve people—not just scale. I'm focused on creating tools that reduce friction in critical life pathways, especially for underserved families navigating housing, healthcare, and public services.</p>
<p>Beyond venture-backed trends, I see massive opportunity in rethinking how we deliver social infrastructure using real-time, contextual AI. Whether it's matching families to housing programs or helping patients understand clinical trials, I build for impact, not just innovation.</p>
<p>Long term, I aim to modernize interoperability within DoD and civilian systems—turning legacy bottlenecks into intelligent pipelines that inform, protect, and empower.</p>

<h4 align="left">🛠 Project Highlights:</h4>
<p>From government systems to grassroots real estate, I apply AI where complexity meets human need. My approach blends automation, decision intelligence, and user-first design to create high-leverage tools that solve real problems.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>AI Pathway Navigator:</strong> A guided decision platform helping families in crisis navigate housing, benefits, and services. Combines dynamic form logic, document intelligence, and contextual LLMs to support both families and caseworkers in real time.</li>
  <li><strong>Clinical Trial AI Assistant:</strong> My graduate capstone project—a retrieval-augmented chatbot that helps patients and providers identify trial eligibility, understand medical jargon, and improve access to research.</li>
  <li><strong>Real Estate Automation Stack:</strong> Building proprietary lead-gen and acquisition tools that turn public records into clean insights for creative finance deals. These systems are tailored for high-volume investors seeking win-win solutions for homeowners.</li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left">🔭 Passion Projects:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Using AI to improve social equity—whether through housing access, health literacy, or service navigation.</li>
  <li>Applying contextual AI to clinical research and health outreach, helping patients overcome complex eligibility and documentation barriers.</li>
  <li>Designing intelligent agents for scenario simulation, resource planning, and decision support in aerospace and government sectors.</li>
  <li>Building a portfolio of proprietary tools for real estate professionals—especially in markets underserved by traditional tech platforms.</li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left">🧠 Capabilities Under Development:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Creating low-latency AI systems from scratch using modular JavaScript frameworks, with planned migration to Python pipelines backed by vectorized retrieval and contextual memory.</li>
  <li>Expanding expertise in creative financing strategies and automating underwriting logic for real estate investments.</li>
  <li>Integrating ethical AI principles into high-impact applications for housing, healthcare, and case management.</li>
  <li>Advancing reinforcement learning and predictive modeling skills to support adaptive systems in real-time decision environments.</li>
  <li>Building production-level data infrastructure that modernizes how legacy institutions share and act on insight.</li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left">👀 Vision:</h4>
<p>To architect AI systems that are resilient, equitable, and scalable—bridging gaps between people and the services they need. I believe technology should not just optimize processes, but uplift lives. My legacy will be in building platforms that bring transparency, choice, and empowerment to the edges of society where it's most needed.</p>
