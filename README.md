<h1 align="center">🛠️ Architecting Human-Centered Systems with Applied AI 🤖</h1>
<h3 align="center">🌍 Charting a Path Where Data Meets Human Impact 🚀 </h3>

<h4 align="left">🎓 Education Snapshot:</h4>
<p>Currently immersing myself in Penn State's MPS in Artificial Intelligence. Venturing beyond, I’m also guiding small real estate entrepreneurs with AI integration into their existing workflows.</p>

<p>What's on my plate this semester? <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>, <strong>Analytical Programming in Python</strong>, and <strong>Data Visualization</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Natural Language Processing:</strong> Exploring statistical NLP with a focus on representation learning and deep neural networks to build end-to-end systems for tasks like question answering, language modeling, and dialogue systems. Hands-on projects using Keras, TensorFlow, and NLTK bring these concepts to life.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytical Programming in Python:</strong> Developing analytics systems by applying software design principles and Python toolkits. The course covers techniques in data manipulation, visualization, machine learning, text analysis, and social network analysis to gain insights from complex data sets.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Learning to map complex, abstract information into physical representations to uncover insights from large data sets. The course emphasizes strategies for effective visualization to support knowledge discovery and decision-making processes.</li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left">📚 What else is catching my interest? </h4>
<p>Exploring innovative creative finance strategies in both residential and commercial real estate to maximize opportunities and outcomes.</p>
<p>Leveraging my growing expertise in Data Science/Engineering to streamline business processes and enhance my investment strategies.</p>
<p>Developing systems and automation solutions for MaxPeak Home Solutions where I serve as the Tech Lead and COO. I bring a blend of technical expertise and leadership to implement cutting-edge technologies, optimize workflows, and drive operational excellence.</p>
<p>Inspired by leaders like Pace Morby and continuously learning to push boundaries in creative finance and technology integration.</p>

<h4 align="left">🎯 Future Me:</h4>
<p>My vision is rooted in building AI systems that serve people—not just scale. I'm focused on creating tools that reduce friction in critical life pathways, especially for underserved families navigating housing, healthcare, and public services.</p>

<p>Beyond venture-backed trends, I see massive opportunity in rethinking how we deliver social infrastructure using real-time, contextual AI. Whether it's matching families to housing programs or helping patients understand clinical trials, I build for impact, not just innovation.</p>

<p>Long term, I aim to modernize interoperability within DoD and civilian systems—turning legacy bottlenecks into intelligent pipelines that inform, protect, and empower.</p>

<h4 align="left">🛠 Project Highlights:</h4>
<p>From government systems to grassroots real estate, I apply AI where complexity meets human need. My approach blends automation, decision intelligence, and user-first design to create high-leverage tools that solve real problems.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>AI Pathway Navigator:</strong> A guided decision platform helping families in crisis navigate housing, benefits, and services. Combines dynamic form logic, document intelligence, and contextual LLMs to support both families and caseworkers in real time.</li>
  <li><strong>Clinical Trial AI Assistant:</strong> My graduate capstone project—a retrieval-augmented chatbot that helps patients and providers identify trial eligibility, understand medical jargon, and improve access to research.</li>
  <li><strong>Real Estate Automation Stack:</strong> Building proprietary lead-gen and acquisition tools that turn public records into clean insights for creative finance deals. These systems are tailored for high-volume investors seeking win-win solutions for homeowners.</li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left">🔭 Passion Projects:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Using AI to improve social equity—whether through housing access, health literacy, or service navigation.</li>
  <li>Applying contextual AI to clinical research and health outreach, helping patients overcome complex eligibility and documentation barriers.</li>
  <li>Designing intelligent agents for scenario simulation, resource planning, and decision support in aerospace and government sectors.</li>
  <li>Building a portfolio of proprietary tools for real estate professionals—especially in markets underserved by traditional tech platforms.</li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left">🧠 Capabilities Under Development:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Creating low-latency AI systems from scratch using modular JavaScript frameworks, with planned migration to Python pipelines backed by vectorized retrieval and contextual memory.</li>
  <li>Expanding expertise in creative financing strategies and automating underwriting logic for real estate investments.</li>
  <li>Integrating ethical AI principles into high-impact applications for housing, healthcare, and case management.</li>
  <li>Advancing reinforcement learning and predictive modeling skills to support adaptive systems in real-time decision environments.</li>
  <li>Building production-level data infrastructure that modernizes how legacy institutions share and act on insight.</li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left">👀 Vision:</h4>
<p>To architect AI systems that are resilient, equitable, and scalable—bridging gaps between people and the services they need. I believe technology should not just optimize processes, but uplift lives. My legacy will be in building platforms that bring transparency, choice, and empowerment to the edges of society where it's most needed.</p>
