<h1 align="center">🔧✨ Architecting Human-Centered Systems with Applied AI 🌍🤖</h1>
<h3 align="center">📊🧠 Charting a Path Where Data Meets Human Impact 🚀💡</h3>

<h4 align="left">🎓 Education Snapshot:</h4>
<p>Currently completing my final semester in Penn State's MPS in Artificial Intelligence. Alongside academic rigor, I architect AI systems that bridge data, policy, and lived experience—empowering real-world users and organizations alike.</p>

<p>What’s on my plate this semester? <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>, <strong>Predictive Analytics</strong>, and <strong>Capstone Research</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Building agents that learn from interaction, optimize decision-making over time, and adapt within high-stakes environments.</li>
  <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> Developing forecasting models to surface insights from high-dimensional, real-world datasets—informing action in domains like healthcare and housing.</li>
  <li><strong>Capstone Project:</strong> Creating a next-generation clinical trial navigator that pairs patients with eligible trials and explains complex medical content using contextual AI. Designed to reduce barriers to research access and support provider communication.</li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left">📚 What else is catching my interest?</h4>
<p>Innovating at the intersection of AI and public infrastructure, with a specific focus on underserved families, social equity, and housing access.</p>
<p>Scaling automation and decision-support tools for real estate entrepreneurs through proprietary frameworks that reflect deep domain expertise in creative finance.</p>
<p>Leading tech innovation at MaxPeak Home Solutions, where we’re redefining what’s possible in real estate acquisition using intelligent systems, strategic outreach, and non-traditional capital structures.</p>
<p>Inspired by visionary operators like Pace Morby—my work goes beyond tactics to build enduring systems that support ethical, scalable real estate outcomes.</p>

<h4 align="left">🎯 Future Me:</h4>
<p>I’m focused on building contextual AI systems that serve people navigating real-world challenges—whether that’s a family searching for housing, a caseworker managing social services, or a patient trying to access a clinical trial.</p>

<p>My work bridges data engineering, LLM-powered assistants, and real-time automation to create high-impact tools that reduce complexity and restore agency. I believe the next generation of infrastructure—public and private—will be powered by intelligent systems designed for equity, not just efficiency.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I’m committed to modernizing how information flows across institutions like the DoD, healthcare systems, and housing agencies. That means replacing fragmented, legacy processes with transparent, ethical, and interoperable AI frameworks that scale.</p>

<h4 align="left">🛠 Project Highlights:</h4>
<p>From government systems to grassroots real estate, I apply AI where complexity meets human need. My approach blends automation, decision intelligence, and user-first design to create high-leverage tools that solve real problems.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>AI Pathway Navigator:</strong> A guided decision platform helping families in crisis navigate housing, benefits, and services. Combines dynamic form logic, document intelligence, and contextual LLMs to support both families and caseworkers in real time.</li>
  <li><strong>Clinical Trial AI Assistant:</strong> My graduate capstone project—a retrieval-augmented chatbot that helps patients and providers identify trial eligibility, understand medical jargon, and improve access to research.</li>
  <li><strong>Real Estate Automation Stack:</strong> Building proprietary lead-gen and acquisition tools that turn public records into clean insights for creative finance deals. These systems are tailored for high-volume investors seeking win-win solutions for homeowners.</li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left">🔭 Passion Projects:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Building AI tools that help families access housing and support services through intelligent guidance and document-aware assistants.</li>
  <li>Improving access to clinical trials with NLP-powered chatbots that simplify eligibility and support patient decision-making.</li>
  <li>Designing autonomous real estate acquisition systems that turn raw data into actionable insights for creative deal structuring.</li>
  <li>Developing applied AI agents for decision support in public sector and defense workflows.</li>
  <li>Championing ethical AI design in high-impact, real-world applications.</li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left">🧠 Capabilities Under Development:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Engineering full-stack AI apps using Node.js frontends with Python-based RAG pipelines and persistent memory.</li>
  <li>Automating creative finance workflows for lead evaluation, seller communication, and real estate underwriting.</li>
  <li>Fine-tuning healthcare NLP models for summarization and patient-level personalization.</li>
  <li>Modernizing government systems through AI-powered data processing and workflow automation.</li>
  <li>Embedding fairness, transparency, and trust into AI systems for public use.</li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left">👀 Vision:</h4>
<p>To architect AI systems that are resilient, equitable, and scalable—bridging gaps between people and the services they need. I believe technology should not just optimize processes, but uplift lives. My legacy will be in building platforms that bring transparency, choice, and empowerment to the edges of society where it's most needed.</p>
